# Huffman Compression Project

## Description:
Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm, is harnessed in this project to assign variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, optimizing compression. The program utilizes a priority queue and a custom binary tree to implement this algorithm. The process involves reading a specified file, counting byte frequencies, creating a Huffman coding tree, displaying encoding tables, and compressing the file. The compressed data is written to a file, accompanied by a header containing Huffman codes. The program can then read the compressed file, decode it, and output the decompressed file, ensuring fidelity to the original.


This project seamlessly integrates file compression and decompression functionalities through the implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm, providing an efficient solution for lossless data compression.
